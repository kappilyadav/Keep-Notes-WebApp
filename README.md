# Keep-Notes-WebApp
Note-taking web application built on the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack. Our web application provides users with a simple and efficient way to organize their notes, whether it be for work, school, or personal use.

# Backend ðŸ› 
At the backend, we use MongoDB as our database to store and manage user data. With its flexibility and scalability, MongoDB provides us with the perfect solution for handling large amounts of data. Our backend is built on Node.js, a popular and versatile JavaScript runtime, that allows us to write efficient server-side code.

# Frontend ðŸ’»
On the frontend, we have used ReactJS, a powerful and widely-used JavaScript library, to create an intuitive interface. Frontend provides users with an easy-to-use interface to create, edit, and organize their notes. With React's powerful state management and reusable components, we are able to deliver a fast and responsive user experience.
